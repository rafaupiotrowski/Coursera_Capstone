In this project, I would like to explore two polish cities' districts -Cracow and Warsaw.
I would like to use cities shapefiles and data from Foursqare.
In the first place, I would like to create choroplets with most popular types of venues for both cities.
This type of maps could be useful to quikcly find similiar districts, for example by tourists or investors.
Then, I would like to group districts into few cluster (no assumptions about the number), taking into considearation what kind of venues could be find there.
If possible, I would like measure degree of similarity between elements in clusters.
This kind of data can be useful if, for example, someone is running bussiness in one place, and wants find similar environment in different city.
Also, this information could be used,for exaple, by travel agency to suggest clients new destination, similiar to places he/she visited previously.
As an extra task, I will try to find correlation between different types of venues in districts (is number of italian restaurants correlated with number of coffe shops?).
I hope I will find some interesting and surprising conclusions.
